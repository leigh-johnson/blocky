# Blocky Bird

# [Live Demo] (http://app.leighjohnson.me/blocky "demo")

### A Flappy Bird clone

### Created using [Phaser](http://phaser.io/ "Phaser") and Thomas Palef's tutorial via [lessmilk](http://blog.lessmilk.com/how-to-make-flappy-bird-in-html5-1/ "lessmilk blog")

My first attempt to make an HTML5 game. Enjoy!

Future features to implement:
* High score tracking
* Multitouch support
